# Executive summary

As junior statisticians at Petit Poll, we were asked by Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario to survey Ontario to understand how citizens of Ontario feel about the implemented COVID-19 policies and to show how effective respondents think that the policies are at combating COVID-19. In this paper, we have the intention of guiding the Conservative Party geared towards improving policies that further improve how the government is handling this pandemic. From our study, we found that citizens could gain the most satisfaction from ...

# Introduction

As the province of Ontario is currently experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic, the Progressive Conservative Party should know how the general public's opinion on the effectiveness and satisfaction of the implemented preventative policies to combat the virus. The survey will not only provide an understanding of voter's satisfaction towards the Conservative Party which is crucial for re-election of leadership, but also help develop better policies that economically help Ontario citizens while keeping the risk of COVID at a minimum. 

Using sampled data based on weighted variables that were reflected by numerous other sources such as Statistic Canada and the CES survey data (cited in Reference) in order to randomized simulated responses weighted responses based on past surveys. Details on how we weighted different responses will be explained in Survey Methodology. By using simulated responses, this paper highlights the concerns that citizens of Ontario may have on the implemented COVID-related policies, given a decrease in new COVID cases in July-August following an alarming uprising of new cases in late September/ early October. Although there were many policies implemented by the Conservative Party, the targeted attributes of new policies that we believe to be the most important in terms of financial stability, public safety, social interactions, students, and businesses in others words our economy. By studying the outcomes we will be able to understand which policies should be improved on and how the government can better deal with the pandemic. 

Our findings suggest that ... 

# Survey methodology 

Given that our survey is purposed for receiving feedback about how the Ontario government is handling the spread of COVID-19, our main target audience is Ontario residents. We want a wide variety of opinions so we are aiming to collect information from residents regardless of gender and age (over 18) and analyze how different demographics respond to the policies the Conservative administration are considering. Ideally, we want an equal sample among all genders and age groups within our responses in order to have equal sampled variables to analyze in depth. However, our sampling simulation will be based off of data collected by Statistics Canada which has recently collected data on COVID-19 concerns and articles that discuss the opinions of Canadians on how the government is handling the pandemic - this will be discussed more in-depth in Data Development. Since our data will be loosely based off of real opinions, we will be taking random samples simply with adjusted weights based on referenced material. 
In terms of reaching an audience for a real world situation, we think the most feasible way to collect this type of information would be to crowdsource responses from volunteers same as how Statistics Canada has done. With the survey we have made, our plan would be to share it through online platforms and take responses from willing volunteers within the Ontario region. This method to collect responses presents virtually no cost from our end but limits our respondents to those who have internet access and are willing to take the survey. This sort of approach may leave certain demographics being under represented in our responses such as people without internet and older people who may not be familiar with technology. Our plan to work around this issue would be to conduct the survey through crowdsourcing online first and then identifying certain demographics that are under represented and devise strategies towards targeting those populations later on so we end up with a sample that represents all Ontario residents in the end. In terms of keeping responses private, we have taken careful consideration in ensuring none of our questions force a respondent to answer nor will an answer potentially compromise a respondent's identity.


# Data Development
  In order to simulate our survey with little bias and deviation, we weight each survey question with different probabilities. From a survey referenced from Statistic Canada titled "Impacts of COVID-19 on Canadians", we see that around 63% of respondents reported to be female, 37% male, and no answers were other - out of 242519 data points. Referencing from the same survey, around 16% of respondents were between 18-29, 29% were between 30-39, 22% were between 40-49, 16% were between 50-59, and another 17% were above the age of 60. Given the proportions from this existing survey, we sampled our weights for gender and age group accordingly. Referenced from an article from Global News written by Kerri Green, since she conducted a survey conducted by Global News, around 75% Canadians approve of another lock down. Therefore our question 3 and 7 in our simulated surveys are weighted greater towards the idea of a new lock down and reduced social gatherings. 
  Referencing from an article posted by Nicole Bogard on CTV news, many of the people that were interviewed said that CERB was only able to cover daily expenses and many had to dip into savings and even RRSP therefore we concluded that we should weight questions 5 and 6 with higher probabilities of having financial instability and heavy CERB reliability. To understand how respondents feel about the reopening of schools, I referenced an article written by Katherine DeClerq stating that as of Monday September 28th, 335 schools in Ontario have reported lab-confirmed cases of the virus and parents are still ambiguous about having their kids in class rooms. Although Premier Doug Ford announced $35 million in funding for schools, the uprising of COVID-19 cases through schools is alarming and many parents would rather their kids to participate in online classes and schools should not shutdown completely to not fall behind in curriculum (DeClerq). Therefore for question 9, we weighted more towards online classes and stricter policies within in person classes. For the final question relating to the overall confidence level of respondents on how the Conservative Party is handling the 2nd wave of COVID-19, we referenced the survey conducted by Statistic Canada - "Impacts of COVID-19 on Canadians" - the question regarding the concern level of the impact of COVID-19. This question had a result that 47.9% of the answers were very concerned, while 2% of the answers were not at all concerned; therefore our simulated probabilities were shifted towards respondents being not confident enough in how the Progressive Conservative Party is handling the pandemic.

# Exploratory Data Analysis/Discussion for the 

When we specifically analyze the demographic of younger adults aged from 18-29, we know that this group of people is mainly comprised of students and working adults early in their career. This is a demographic of people who are generally less financially stable as we can see through Figures 1 and 4 when we asked respondents to rate their reliability on aid and financial stability from 1-10 and we can see that it is the case for this age group. We see there is a strong reliance on government aid with the left skewed distribution of answers in Figure 1 and right skewed distributions for Figure 4. In terms of business shutdowns and economic stability, these responses are valuable for the Ontario Conservative party to judge how tight lockdown policies may negatively affect students' and young adults' financial situations. It is definitely a hard factor to balance when we factor in more the responses about tighter lockdowns and one's ability to self-isolate. According to Figure 2 and Figure 3, we see that the young adult demographic is generally in support of tighter lockdown restrictions and are mostly able to self-isolate while continuing with work/school. Taking this response into account, the provincial government is tasked with handling the support for further restrictions while doing it with a method to minimize job loss. While this is a general dilemma any government must deal during the time of a pandemic, taking the data and analyzing responses from a young adult demographic provides clearer understanding for developing a COVID-19 procedure to balance for the general population.

```{r young_adults}

young_people <- filter(survey_data, age_grp == "18-29")

ggplot(young_people, aes(x=CERB_reliability)) + geom_bar() + labs(title = "Figure 1. Young Adults' Reliance on Government Aid", x = "Sliding Scale (1 being not reliant on aid, 10 being very reliant on aid)")

ggplot(young_people, aes(x=isolate_ability)) + geom_bar() + labs(title = "Figure 2. Young Adults' Ability to Self-Isolate", x = " ")

ggplot(young_people, aes(x=shut_down)) + geom_bar() + labs(title = "Figure 3. Young Adults' Opinion on Tighter Lockdowns", x = "Sliding Scale (1 being strongly against shutdown, 10 being in support for shutdown")

ggplot(young_people, aes(x=financial_stability)) + geom_bar() + labs(title = "Figure 4. Young Adults' Financial Stability", x = "Sliding Scale (1 being unsure of financial status, 10 being stable in financial status)")

# Data Analysis/Discussion for the Opinions on Reopening Schools

In order to see how parents of kids feel about the reopening of schools, we isolated the age group and opinions of schools columns and filtered the data for respondents between the ages of 30 and 60. This filter was done since parents generally between the ages of 30 and 60 have their kids actively going to school and provide the most significance opinions on how the government is handling the reopening of schools, especially since the rise of COVID-19 cases in schools since schools reopened (DeClerq). From Figure 5, we can see that majority of the responses are either still having in person classes but with stricter social distancing policies, or switching classes to online completely. This allows us to conclude that parents, generally between the ages of 30 and 60, are not happy with the current state of schools and would want the Conservative Party to implement better policies that either reduces risks by better social-distancing, or completely eliminating the risk by switching to virtual classes. 

```{r opinion_on_schools}
#Selects the two columns that we want to analyze
parents_on_schools <- survey_data %>%
  select(age_grp, schools)

#Filters the general age group for most parents
parents_on_schools %>% filter(age_grp == c("30-39", "40-49", "50-59"))

ggplot(parents_on_schools, aes(x=schools))+ geom_bar()+ labs(title = "Figure 5. Parent's Opinions on Reopening of Schools", x = "Opinion on Schools")
